# Calorimetry Data Processing
Most of the magic happens in cal_data_import.py, which reads TSV.txt files from Calmetrix CalCommander2 logger, separates run parameters from logged data, performs calculations, and stores parameters and values in separate sheets in an excel worksbook. To run, drag .txt files onto cal_data_import.bat.
Other scripts for various calorimetry data processing purposes.
